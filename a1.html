          &emsp; In Japanese mythology, Susanoo is a legendary god, born from Izanagi's face. In Shintoism, he is the god of the storms and the sea, born from Izanagi, the creator of Japan. However, he got into a fight with his sister, Amateratsu, where he lost and started to burn rice fields, killed one of Amateratsu's horse, and killed one of her servants.

        <h5>Yamato-No-Orochi</h5>
        &emsp; When Susanoo was kicked out of the heavens and landed on Earth, he discovered an old couple with a beautiful daughter unconrollably sobbing. Susanoo asked them why they were distressed and they told him that a dangerous 8-headed serpent Orochi came every year to eat one of their daughters. Susanoo being himself, struck a deal that if he kills Orochi, he gets to marry their daughter.

        <br>&emsp; Like any smart and powerful warrior, Susanoo lured the serpent with sake and got it blackout drunk with sake. He then slashed all eight of its drunk heads off and cut off its tail where the legendary sword, Kusanagi, sprung out. Afterwords , he then married the couples daughter, who became a god known as Kushinadahime, the goddess of rice. The sword that he butchered away from Orochi was given to Amateratsu, presumably to apologize to her. Later on, Amateratsu gave it to the first Japanese Emperor and it is now considered to be one of the Three Regalia of Japan, kept at Atsuta Shrine in Nagoya. As time passed, he became eventually became the ruler of Neno-Katasu-Kuni.
